# Tic-Tac-Bot

The project was part of a Basics of IoT course. The main aim of the project was to develop a functional tic tac toe chat bot for the popular VoIP platform Discord. The bot is running on a Raspberry Pi SoC and was written in Python using the discord.py API wrapper for the Discord service.
